The Quiz Card application is an application created to help people gain knowlegde or rather to exercise their minds. Its an application that has 4 screens, in these four screens there's a screen that is only about the introduction of the application so it is basically the welcome screen to application. Which has two buttons and two text views the other button is for you to start with quiz game then it redirects you to the main screen which is our second screen in this case, where you are now able to generate the questions one by one and same time you get an answer if whether your answer is correct or incorrect.It is a true or false game you only have two options to choose your answer you can take the game as a guess work game but there are conditions in the game. If you perhapes score a 3/5 it means you did a good job but if you want to better your score you can restart the game after reviewing how did on the game.If you score less than 3 it means you did not do good you can do better just by re-playing the game starting the game over and make sure do better in the game.The game is created to educate people in a quite easy manner because we know it is draining to read a book as a whole trying to find facts but it taking long and written in small font. Quizes help improve understanding,knowledge and for one to track their progress.
